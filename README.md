# Python for Data Science at PT Hacktivate

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the [**Independent Study**](https://kampusmerdeka.kemdikbud.go.id/program/studi-independen/detail) program titled **Python for Data Science** at [**PT Hacktivate**](https://www.hacktiv8.com/), held by the [**Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology**](https://www.kemdikbud.go.id/main/). Throughout this program, I completed several **assignments** and **final projects**. I will briefly describe each assignment and final project below:

## Assignments
1. [**Advanced Visualization**](https://github.com/darren7753/H8_3/tree/master/PYTN_Assgn_1_3_Darren) - In this assignment, I used the London Crime data from Kaggle to create advanced visualizations using Python. I received a score of 100/100 for this assignment.

2. [**Inferential Statistics**](https://github.com/darren7753/H8_3/tree/master/PYTN_Assgn_2_3_Darren) - In this assignment, I used the NYC Property Sales data from Kaggle to perform inferential statistics using Python. I received a score of 100/100 for this assignment.

3. [**Classification with Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**](https://github.com/darren7753/H8_3/tree/master/PYTN_Assgn_3_3_Darren) - In this assignment, I used the Bank Marketing data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to perform classification using various algorithms including logistic regression, KNN, SVM, naive bayes, decision tree, and random forest. I received a score of 100/100 for this assignment.

## Final Projects
1. [**Linear and Polynomial Regressions Predicting Prices**](https://github.com/darren7753/H8_3/tree/master/PYTN_KampusMerdeka_fp1_Athifah_Darren) - In this final project, I used the Uber and Lyft (Boston, MA) data from Kaggle to perform linear and polynomial regressions to predict prices. I received a score of 100/100 for this project.

2. [**Logistic Regression and SVM Predicting Rain**](https://github.com/darren7753/H8_3/tree/master/PYTN_KampusMerdeka_fp2_Athifah_Darren) - In this final project, I used the Rain in Australia data from Kaggle to build logistic regression and SVM models to predict if it will rain tomorrow. I received a score of 100/100 for this project.

3. [**Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Predicting Survival of Patients**](https://github.com/darren7753/H8_3/tree/master/PYTN_KampusMerdeka_fp3_Athifah_Darren) - In this final project, I used the Heart Failure Prediction data from Kaggle to build random forest and gradient boosting models to predict the survival of patients. I received a score of 100/100 for this project.

4. [**Factor Analysis and K-Means Clustering to Segment Credit Card Customers**](https://github.com/darren7753/H8_3/tree/master/PYTN_KampusMerdeka_fp4_Athifah_Darren) - In this final project, I used the Credit Card for Clustering data from Kaggle to perform factor analysis and k-means clustering to segment credit card customers. I received a score of 100/100 for this project.
